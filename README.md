# Newtons-Method-for-non-linear
This was a problem from my final project in Numerical Calculus III.
It can easily be adapted to any non-linear system of equations.
In numerical analysis, Newton's method is a method for finding successively 
better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
